# discordBot

This is my personal Discord bot! This bot implements the github REST API to make CRUD calls for info. The intention is to easily be able to fetch and display any solutions for an available LeetCode question
in discord. This would allow communities to show solutions all in one place instead of navigating through different pages and links.

This bot will also have some moderation features on the side, but that's not really the main priority for making this bot. This project is mainly to be used for learning how discord bots operate and how to work 
with RESTful API's!
